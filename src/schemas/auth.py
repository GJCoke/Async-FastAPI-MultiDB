"""
Auth schemas.

Why do we separate the request model, response model,
 and database model in our design? Canâ€™t we just use a single model for all purposes?

 - It allows each model to focus on its specific task, making the code easier to maintain.

 - Request and response models leverage Pydantic for data validation, ensuring the data meets the expected structure.

 - Separating request and response models helps to avoid returning sensitive database fields (e.g., password fields),
  enhancing security.

 - You can independently extend or modify each layer without affecting others, such as modifying the database model
  fields while leaving the request and response models unchanged.

 - Having request and response models as distinct layers ensures that all inputs and outputs adhere to
  the defined structure, preventing confusion.

 - The independence of each model makes unit testing easier, as each model has clear responsibilities and functions.

 - The layered design allows for easy replacement, modification, or extension of any layer when needed,
  without affecting others.
